I had been brutally reminded that, as of this day, I have zero to no online presence besides my facebook page that I have not updated since September.  
  
Some friends have tried to give me hints at what I can blog about, and here's a tentative list:  

* Subjecting the internet to my crap photoshop art
* Write about the handful of games that I have not very excelled at playing at (but still insist on playing nonetheless)
* Write about softward development

After some rumination I painfully gave in, but at this very moment I chanced upon this wonderful piece of ancient wisdom:   

> "Elbow, you know, the bendy part."  
>             ---William Shatner Shakespeare  

The wise man enlightened me that it doesn't matter what you say, if you say it often enough people will probably understand you or catch on.  

So I regrettably inform you, my imaginary audience, that I will be typing nonesense in the hope that you, my imageinary audience, will cherish me for it.
